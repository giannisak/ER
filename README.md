# Entity Resolution with Small-Scale LLMs: A Study on Prompting Strategies and Hardware Limitations

## Description

This repository contains the study materials for a master's thesis exploring the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to entity resolution tasks. The study investigates various prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches, and evaluates their performance on entity matching scenarios.

## Key Aspects

- Exploration of different prompting techniques
- Implementation using the Ollama framework
- Performance evaluation on Abt-Buy and Walmart-Amazon datasets
- Analysis of LLM behavior in entity matching tasks

## Further Information
